Design a program that will read a file of sales records and produce a sales report. Each record in the file contains a customer's number and name, a sales amount and a tax code. The tax code is to be applied to the sales amount to determine the sales tax due for that sale, as follows:Â 
Tax Code	Sales Tax
0			tax exempt
1			3%
2			5%
The report must print a heading, "Sales Report", followed by detail lines. Each detail line must list the customer number, name, sales amount, sales tax and the total amount due.
